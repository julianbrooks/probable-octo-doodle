This will combine some basic data handling, plotting, and writing functions.
You will probably want to have the docs/help open to support you!

The base code is provided at the bottom - you can add to this, change it, or remove it and write your own if you prefer!

You are welcome to add more options to the menu and create your own graphs - think of how you can use the different styles of graph.

For example - you could add box and whisker diagrams to show averages, or scatter plots to show outliers.

The data set 'ramen-ratings.csv' draws from a popular blog rating instant ramen products.
