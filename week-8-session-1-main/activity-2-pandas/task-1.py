# For each of the following pieces of information, try and use pandas to find the answer from the dataset in 'data'
# leave your code under the comments.

# Find the total number of students

# Find the mean average GPA of the students

# Find the standard deviation of how much sleep students get per day

# Find the maximum amount of study hours per day

# Sort the students by social hours per day ascending (lowest -> highest)

# Add a column 'Total_hours' which adds together all the Hours_Per_Day columns into one

# Filter all students with a 'high' stress level, and all the students with a 'low' stress level.
# Can you work out whether having a higher stress level leads to a higher GPA?
