# week 8 : Session 1

This session looks at a variety of python libraries.

Remember: in order to complete activity 2 and 3, you may need to **pip install** the libraries as they are third-party.

You can do this using the following commands:


```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Running MatPlotLib Code

In order to use the method your lecturer will show to run matplotlib, you will need to install:
- The Python extension
- The Jupyter extension

Once both of these are installed, you can:
1. Click the arrow next to the run button
2. Select 'Run in Interactive Window'
Your code will then open in a tab to the side - this will be able to display graphs. You can still enter user inputs- a pop-up box will appear in the top centre of the screen for this.

To re-run code after changes, close the interactive window and re-run it using the steps above.

If there are errors in your code, the interactive window will print them out to you.

## Links to Docs

If you're getting stuck, or just want to know more, the documentation for libraries is a great source of information and functions.

Random: [Read the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

Pandas: [Read the docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Matplotlib: [Read the docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)

## Datasets

All datasets provided by Kaggle - if you want to find a free dataset on anything, this is a good site to find them to practice with!
